# Advent of code :tada:

Probably will be done with [Teal](https://github.com/teal-language/tl) for the most part. But I'd like to try out some Ada and Zig at somepoint too.

Also feel free to steal the `grabInput` script


## Random Thoughts

Since I'm using this to learn new languages, I thought I might write down some stuff.

### Ada

 - Loving the type system so far
 - Neat that it's a low level language with non-C syntax
 	- Declaring a type with `type Foo is record ... end record;` then declaring how the fields are arranged/aligned in the bits in the next few lines is cool
 - I'm not a fan of the standard library's weird Pascal\_Snake\_Case
 	- But apparently Ada is case insensitive????
